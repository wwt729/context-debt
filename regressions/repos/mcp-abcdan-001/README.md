# mcp.json 🤖
This repository contains my Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configurations for both professional and personal use. These configurations are compatible with Cursor, Claude.ai, and Claude Code.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up MCP servers, ensure you have:

- **Node.js**: A recent version (recommended: v18 or higher)
- **Figma API Key**: Required for Figma integration
  - Follow the [official Figma guide](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens) to generate your personal access token
- **Cursor**: A license
- **Claude.ai**: A license, preferably Max 5x.
- **BrowserMCP**: Installed in your browser. Get it [here](https://browsermcp.io/)

## Installation & Setup

### Cursor IDE Setup
1. Open the command palette using `Cmd+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+P` (Windows/Linux)
2. Type `>MCP` in the command palette
3. Copy and paste the contents from the `mcp.json` file into the configuration

### Claude Code Setup

To add the browser MCP server to Claude Code, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add browser npx @browsermcp/mcp@latest -s user
```

To add the Context 7 MCP server to Claude Code, run the following comand.
```
claude mcp add -s user context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp
```

## Tips!
- For Context 7 for documentation, explicity ask your AI assistant to use Context 7.
- For Figma, it only works with 1:1 Figma urls pasted in.
- In general, ask for the tool to be used.

## Configuration File

The `mcp.json` file contains all server configurations. Make sure to review and customize the settings according to your needs before applying them to your development environment.
